# Your first Linux task - Start httpd

_Use all the resources available to you, to tackle a challenge you don't yet know how to complete._

New software products come out all the time, and as technical professionals you will often be given tasks you don't yet know how to complete. Throughout this course you will be challenged with tasks that you haven't really been taught how to complete either, to emulate that real-world industry experience.

You have been given an IP address to a server that you will connect with via SSH. The username is `centos` and the password will be given to you by your instructor. It has a piece of software, `httpd`, installed on it. `httpd` is the most popular web server in the world, serving around a third of the internet's traffic. This document may be hosted on a `httpd` server somewhere in the world right now.

**You have one job: start `httpd`.**

Once you've completed this task, you will be able to enter the IP address of your server in your browser. It will load a "HTTP SERVER TEST PAGE" - this means you have completed the task successfully.

We haven't told you how to do this, which means you're going to have to work it out for yourself. Use Google, use your colleagues, ask questions. Type in commands and see if they work. Don't worry - the worst you can do is break your machine, it's not the end of the world. Don't worry if you don't 100% understand everything that's going on - you'll get more comfortable, with time and with the training you'll be doing over the next few weeks.

## Goals

1. Connect to the provided Linux computer with an SSH Client
1. Work out how to start the "httpd" application
1. Test that it is running by entering the IP address of the computer in your browser

## Extra time

Can you change what the "HTTP SERVER TEST PAGE" says?
