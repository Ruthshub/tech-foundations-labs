# Fix a broken service

*Troubleshooting is a core skill for all tech workers*
Computers are infuriatingly literal. A missed space, an errant comma - do you uderstand this sentence? A computer wouldn't. So troubleshooting - working methodically through a problem until you find the root cause, before applying a fix - is essential to all tech work.

This virtual machine is meant to be running httpd - but **it has a configuration error. Fix the error.** Check the logs, check the internet, try restarting it. Your goal is to get httpd to start again, so we can see the test page.

## Goals

1. Troubleshoot why httpd won't start
1. Start httpd to make it load the working configuration
1. Browse to the IP address of your server to check the new website is there
