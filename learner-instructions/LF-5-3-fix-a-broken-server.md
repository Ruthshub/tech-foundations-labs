# Fix a broken server

Our website has gone down, and the guy that runs it.. well, he's not here anymore. All that's left is a post-it note that says "SSH: 2000". Who knows what that means.

Fix it.

## Goals

1. Return SSH to it's standard port.
1. Get the website - with the title "Our Website" - up and running again.
1. Ensure this fix persists after reboot.
